## Description
TaskTrack is a **task management system** that helps users efficiently track and manage tasks.  
It consists of a **backend (Spring Boot)** and a **frontend (React.js)**.  
Below are the steps to set up and run both services.

## Features
- User authentication and role-based access
- Task creation, assignment, and tracking
- Status updates and deadline management
- Visual representation of tasks
- Secure API integration using JWT

## Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+ installed
- Maven installed
- MySQL database configured

### Steps to Run
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd Backend/ReactRealOne
   \`\`\`
2. Configure database settings in \`application.properties\`.
3. Build and run the project:
   \`\`\`bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   \`\`\`
4. The backend should now be running on \`http://localhost:8080\`.

## Frontend Setup (React)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed

### Steps to Run
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd Fronted/TaskTrack
   \`\`\`
2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`
3. Start the React development server:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm start
   \`\`\`
4. The frontend should now be running on \`http://localhost:3000\`.
